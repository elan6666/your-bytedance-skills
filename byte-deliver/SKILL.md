# Byte Deliver

Deliver creates the final handoff for the built product. It should make the result usable by a human who was not present during the session.

## Inputs

Read:

```text
.byte-os/BYTE.md
.byte-os/OKRS.md
.byte-os/PRODUCT_SPEC.md
.byte-os/ROADMAP.md
.byte-os/plans/*.plan.md
.byte-os/BUILD_LOG.md
.byte-os/reviews/*.md
.byte-os/iterations/*.md
.byte-os/users/*.md
```

Inspect the actual repository or deliverable files.

## Delivery Checks

Verify:

- Product goal is clear.
- MVP scope is complete or known gaps are documented.
- Build or artifact exists.
- Run instructions are accurate.
- Tests or manual verification are recorded.
- Review verdict allows delivery, or risks are explicitly accepted.
- Real user feedback is not claimed unless `byte-users` ran on real evidence.
- Objective and Key Results status are summarized honestly.
- Parked entries in `.byte-os/FUTURE.md` are excluded from remaining work,
  delivery risks, known gaps, and completion. They may be summarized only as
  an optional non-blocking count.

For a web app or app requiring a server, start the dev server when appropriate and provide the local URL. If opening a static HTML file is enough, provide the absolute file path.

## Artifact

Write:

```text
.byte-os/DELIVERY.md
```

Include:

```text
# Product

# What Was Delivered

# How To Run

# How To Test

# Key Files

# Verification

# OKR Status

# Review And Iteration Summary

# Known Gaps

# Recommended Next Steps

# Real User Feedback Status
```

Update `STATUS.md` using the shared Byte OS state contract:

```text
stage: delivered
current_workflow: byte-deliver
next_workflow: byte-status
```

Do not route to `byte-users` until the user supplies real feedback evidence.

## Completion Criteria

Delivery is complete when the user can run or inspect the result and understands what is complete, what is risky, and what to do next.
Parked future entries never prevent delivery.
